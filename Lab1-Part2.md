## How do we do more with less in an AI-driven world? As automation reshapes roles, how do we justify the value of human talent? By mastering the art of crafting AI prompts that drive critical thinking and strategic decision-making, we empower future leaders to tackle challenges and create impactful solutions..

### Here’s how to structure your prompts for critical thinking:

### 1. Define the Objective
>Clearly state what you want the prompt to achieve. For example guiding a specific learning outcome or task.

 1. **Be Specific**: Clearly outline what you want the learner to achieve or demonstrate (e.g., solve a problem, analyze a situation, or develop a skill)
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: Frame the objective around the desired outcome, such as improving decision-making, fostering creativity, or deepening understanding.

3. **Clarify the Scope**: Set clear boundaries for the prompt, ensuring learners know the scope of the task and what's expected in their response. 

    #### *Prompt example* ####
    >My project deadline is approaching in two weeks. What steps would you take to prioritize tasks, manage available resources, and mitigate potential challenges to ensure successful completion?"

Clearly outlining the scenario allows individuals to maintain autonomy in strategically thinking through the context, developing decision-making skills. This approach leverages generative AI to quickly analyze, review, and plan tasks, enhancing time management and agility.

>**Tip**: When defining the objective, ensure that the prompt encourages learners to consider both short-term actions and long-term consequences. This helps them build a comprehensive understanding and improve their critical thinking and decision-making skills.

### 2. Foster Strategic Thinking 

> Design prompts that push learners to analyze situations, evaluate options, and make informed decisions. Encouraging them to justify their reasoning and consider multiple perspectives enhances problem-solving and leadership skills.

1. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Use prompts that require thoughtful responses instead of simple yes/no answers.

2. **Promote Reflection**: Encourage learners to explain their decisions and explore alternative approaches.

3. **Incorporate Real-World Scenarios**: Present scenarios relevant to learners' roles to deepen understanding and practical application.

    #### *Prompt example* ####
    > My project deadline is approaching in two weeks. What steps would you take to prioritize tasks, manage available resources, and mitigate potential challenges to ensure successful completion? In your response, consider the long-term impact of your decisions, the trade-offs between different strategies, and how your approach could evolve as new information becomes available?

### 3. Provide Constructive Feedback

#### To maximize learning, follow up on responses with personalized, constructive feedback. Effective feedback reinforces strengths, highlights areas for improvement, and encourages continuous growth.


1. **Acknowledge Thought Process**: Recognize well-reasoned decisions and creative problem-solving.

2. **Offer Guidance**: Provide actionable suggestions for refining their approach or considering alternative perspectives.




    ***Feedback Example***:
    >You identified resource allocation as a key factor — great insight! Consider also evaluating the potential impact on stakeholder expectations. How might you communicate any adjustments to maintain alignment?
