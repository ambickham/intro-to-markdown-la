## Harness AI prompts to deliver context-driven training that prepares future leaders. Design prompts that go beyond surface-level answers, encouraging learners to analyze, reflect, and think critically to cultivate a culture of decision-making and reasoning.

Hereâ€™s how to structure your prompts for critical thinking:

### 1. Define the Objective

 >Clearly state what you want the prompt to achieve. For example guiding a specific learning outcome or task.

 1. **Be Specific**: Clearly outline what you want the learner to achieve or demonstrate (e.g., solve a problem, analyze a situation, or develop a skill)
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: Frame the objective around the desired outcome, such as improving decision-making, fostering creativity, or deepening understanding.

3. **Clarify the Scope**: Set clear boundaries for the prompt, ensuring learners know the scope of the task and what's expected in their response. 

    #### *Prompt example* ####
>"I have project deadline is approaching in two weeks. What steps would you take to prioritize tasks, manage available resources, and mitigate potential challenges to ensure successful completion?"

Clearly outlining the scenario allows individuals to maintain autonomy in strategically thinking through the context, developing decision-making skills. This approach leverages generative AI to quickly analyze, review, and plan tasks, enhancing time management and agility.

>**Tip**: When defining the objective, ensure that the prompt encourages learners to consider both short-term actions and long-term consequences. This helps them build a comprehensive understanding and improve their critical thinking and decision-making skills.

### 2. Calling a function

#### To execute the function, you *call* or *invoke* it by using its name followed by parentheses.

#### ***Example***:

greet('Alice'); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

### 3. Return values

#### Functions can process data input and output a value using the *return* keyword.

#### ***Example***: 

 ```javascript
 const addNums = (numA, numB) => {
  return numA + numB
 }
```
```javascript
const total = addNums(2, 4);

console.log(total) // Expected value: 6
```
